This is a gravity simulation made for Unity. It is not a full application and is simply a project containing a few scripts that can be used to simulate gravity. All masses (game objects with the MassData component) must be children of a system container object (an empty game object with the Mass System component). You can have multiple systems but they will not interact with each other (keep whatever masses you want to interact with each other in the same system). Relevant files will be found in the assets folder and include MassSystem.cs and MassData.cs.
